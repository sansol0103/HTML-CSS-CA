# Project Title

Rainy Days Course Assignment

## Description

This is my course assignement making the Rainy Days course assignment in HTML and CSS

## Design Changes

There have been a few design changes from the prototype. All text that was previously Archivo has been changed to Roboto for simplicity. Added CTA buttons to the landing page, as that was something pointed out on the design CA. The form elements were changed. It was originally floating buttons, but was changed to be a single block which in my opinion, looks better and more consistent.
